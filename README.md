        <h2>1. WordPress</h2>
        <p>
            Our funding platform is powered by <strong>WordPress</strong>, a robust and flexible content management system. 
            WordPress provides the perfect foundation for managing our content, ensuring a smooth user experience while 
            offering plenty of customization options.

        <h2>2. PHP</h2>
        <p>
            Behind the scenes, <strong>PHP</strong> (Hypertext Preprocessor) powers the core functionality of our website. 
            As the scripting language used by WordPress, PHP allows us to create dynamic and interactive features, 
            ensuring the site runs efficiently and meets the unique needs of our users.
